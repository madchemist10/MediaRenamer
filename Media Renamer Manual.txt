Media Renamer Manual

Overview:
This application is designed to rename media files to a strict format:
{Title} S{SeasonNumber}E{EpisodeNumber}.{FileExtension}


Table of Contents:
1.  Settings
2.  Rename Module
3.  Copy Module


=========================
=       Settings        =
=========================
To achieve this goal there are three setting files:
settings.txt
specialEpisodes.txt
specialRename.txt

Contained within each of these files can be a series of user specified
specific data that interacts with the core application.
All data inputted into these three setting files should be in the
format of:
{key}: {value}

The keys used in the settings.txt file are pre-defined when the application
runs for the first time (which will always fail).

If a line is no longer needed but the user does not want to delete the line:
prepend the line with "###".

The default lines added to the settings files have only one "#" prepending them,
this is to denote which lines must be defined for the application to run correctly.

*************************************************
settings.txt
The possible flags for the settings file are:
DefaultRenameDir
DefaultCopyDir
MaxEpisodeCount
UserInteraction
CopyFiles

All flags must be given a value except:
MaxEpisodeCount

>>DefaultRenameDir
	This is the directory the application will point to for renaming files.
>>DefaultCopyDir
	This is the directory the application will point to for copying files.
>>MaxEpisodeCount
	This is the maximum number of episodes that the user would like for
	the application to recognize.
	Valid values are any integer within the range [0-999].
>>UserInteraction
	This is a "TRUE"/"FALSE" flag that determines if the user would like to
	run the program with GUI or without GUI. If the user chooses to run the
	program without GUI, whatever values the algorithm determines will be 
	be what the program acts upon. If the user chooses to run the program with
	a GUI, the user will have a choice on each episode on if they would like
	to override what the algorithm has determined.
>>CopyFiles
	This is a "TRUE"/"FALSE" flag that determines if the user would like to copy
	files to the defined {DefaultCopyDir} after the renaming has been completed.

*************************************************
specialEpisodes.txt

This file is for the special edge cases where the user would like to rename
their files different than the normal algorithm would determine the outcome,
but based solely on the difference in episode numbers.
Example:
	If the user's file was resolved by the unmodified algorithm to be:
		{title} S01E26.{fileExt}
	and the user wanted this to be the first episode of S02, the user
	should enter into this file (on a new line):
		{title}: S01E25
	This will denote that the first season associated with this title
	only contained 25 episodes; therefore, should have an offset of 25.

Example2:
	If the user's file was resolved by the unmodified algorithm to be:
		{title} S02E13.{fileExt}
	and the user wanted this to be the first episode of S02, the user
	should enter into this file (on a new line):
		{title}: S01E12
	This will denote that the first season associated with this title
	only contained 12 episodes; therefore, should have an offset of 12.

*************************************************
specialRename.txt

This file is for the special edge cases where the user would like to rename
their files different than the normal algorithm would determine the outcome,
but based solely on the difference in the title of the show.
Example:
	If the user's file was resolved by the unmodified algorithm to be:
		{title} S01E01.{fileExt}
	and the user wanted this to be the a different title than reported by
	the algorithm, the user should enter into this file (on a new line):
		{original title}: {new title}
	This will denote that if the {original title} is extracted during the
	renaming process, replace it with the {new title} found in this file.


==============================
=       Rename Module        =
==============================

The rename module is the executable section that attempts to determine
how to rename the media file in the format of {title} S{sNum}E{eNum}.{fileExt}.

============================
=       Copy Module        =
============================

The copy module is the executable section that attempts to copy a renamed
file from the source directory specified in the settings file, to the destination
folder specified in the settings file.
Example:
    File Renamed = {src}\{title} S{sNum}E{eNum}.{fileExt}
    Copied to = {copyDir}\{title}\{title} S{sNum}E{eNum}.{fileExt}

The file will be placed in a subfolder of the {copyDir} with the name of the folder
being the same as the {title} of the media file.

After the copy has completed, if the file that should exist in the destination,
exists, then the original file is deleted.
